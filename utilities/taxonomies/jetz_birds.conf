[rank_mappings]
# The definitions in the rank_mappings section indicate which columns from the input
# CSV file contain taxonomy information and how they map to the rank names used in
# the database.  The format is:
#
# CSV_column_name: database_rank_name
#
# For example, to indicate that the column "ScientificName" in the source CSV file
# contains the species name, the following definition would be used:
#
# ScientificName: Species
#
# If a column name in the CSV file matches the rank name in the database, then the
# definition would be written like this:
#
# Family: Family
#
Scientific: Species
ScientificGenus: Genus
BLFamilyLatin: Family
IOCOrder: Order
