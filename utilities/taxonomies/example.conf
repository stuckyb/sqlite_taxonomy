# 2 = plants, using phyla and its derivatives
# 3 = plants, using divisions and its derivatives

[taxonomy]
# The ID to use for this taxonomy.
taxonomyid = 3
# The name of the taxonomy.
name = BirdLife Taxonomy
# Whether this is a master taxonomy for MOL.

[citation]
# These settings define the citation information for the taxonomy.

# The remaining settings define citation information for the taxa names.  These
# settings are all optional.

# Specifies columns in the CSV file that contains short name authority data and
# full citation information.  (Short citation information is of the form
# "Linnaeus 1758".)  The citation data will be applied to the lowest-level taxon
# that is present in each CSV file row (usually species or subspecies).  These

# This option indicates whether the parser should try to fix the casing of author
# name strings.  If "true", each component of the name will be modified so that the
# first letter is uppercase and the remainder is lowercase.  This is not always
# perfect; e.g., names that begin with "Mc" might be incorrectly cased.
fixcasing = true

# Settings that specify citation information for a specific rank.  The format is:
#
# citation_Rankname = CSV_column_name
#
# where "Rankname" is a rank name used in the taxonomy database.
citation_Species = Author
#citation_Subspecies = SubspAuthor


[root]
# These settings specify the root taxon_concept for this taxonomy.
rank = Class
name = Aves
# Specifies the taxonomy ID for the root taxon *only*, which may be different from
# the taxonomy ID used for the rest of the taxa in the taxonomy.  For most cases,
# this will be 1 (the MOL backbone taxonomy).
taxonomyid = 1 


[taxafilter]
# Options in this section provide information about which rows in the input CSV
# file are to be included in the final taxonomy.  This section is optional.

# The name of a column that indicates which taxa are to be included in the taxonomy.
filtercolumn = BirdLife taxonomic treatment
# A comma-separated list of values for filtercolumn that indicate a taxon is valid.
# To do regular expression filtering, prefix a value with "regex:".
# BirdLife uses R = recognised as a species; NR = not recognised as a species;
# UR = under review.  We only want the "recognised" taxa in the taxonomy.
acceptvalues = R

#rejectvalues = regex:\[.* Group\]


[transformations]
# Options in this section specify transformations to apply to column string values.
# The format of each option is:
# 
# CSV_column_name: regex
#
# Where "regex" is a regular expression to search for and remove from the string.
# To include leading or trailing whitespace in the regular expression, enclose it
# in quotations.  Note that only one transform can be defined for each column.
Subspecies: " [(A-Z].*"


[synonyms]
# The definitions in this section specify how taxon name synonyms should be parsed
# from the input CSV file.  Synonyms will be applied to the lowest-level taxon that
# is present in each CSV file row.  E.g., if a row contains a subspecies name, then
# the synonyms are assumed to apply to the subspecies.  If the row contains only a
# species name (no subspecies), then the synonyms are assumed to apply to the species
# name.  This section is optional.

# The column containing the synonyms.
colname = Synonyms
# The separator character used to delimit multiple synonyms.  If this setting is not
# defined, ',' is used by default.
separator = ;


[rank_mappings]
# The definitions in the rank_mappings section indicate which columns from the input
# CSV file contain taxonomy information and how they map to the rank names used in
# the database.  The format is:
#
# CSV_column_name: database_rank_name
#
# For example, to indicate that the column "ScientificName" in the source CSV file
# contains the species name, the following definition would be used:
#
# ScientificName: Species
#
# If a column name in the CSV file matches the rank name in the database, then the
# definition would be written like this:
#
# Family: Family
#
# "_ParseGenus" is a special pseudo-column name that indicates the genus name for each
# taxon is not provided as a column in the CSV file and should instead be parsed from
# the species name string.  It is used like this:
#
# _ParseGenus: Genus
#
# Similarly, "_ParseSubspecies" is a special pseudo-column name that indicates that
# subspecies names are not provided in a separate column and should instead be parsed
# from the species name string.  It is used like this:
#
# _ParseSubspecies: Subspecies
#
Scientific name: Species
_ParseGenus: Genus
Family name: Family
Order: Order
