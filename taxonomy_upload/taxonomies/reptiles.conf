[taxafilter]
# Options in this section provide information about which rows in the input CSV
# file are to be included in the final taxonomy.  This section is optional.

# The name of a column that indicates which taxa are to be included in the taxonomy.
#filtercolumn = CATEGORY
# A comma-separated list of values for filtercolumn that indicate a taxon is valid.
# To do regular expression filtering, prefix a value with "regex:".

[transformations]
# Options in this section specify transformations to apply to column string values.
# The format of each option is:
# 
# CSV_column_name: regex
#
# Where "regex" is a regular expression to search for and remove from the string.
# To include leading or trailing whitespace in the regular expression, enclose it
# in quotations.  Note that only one transform can be defined for each column.

# This option indicates whether the parser should try to fix the casing of author
# name strings.  If "true", each component of the name will be modified so that the
# first letter is uppercase and the remainder is lowercase.  This is not always
# perfect; e.g., names that begin with "Mc" might be incorrectly cased.

# This option specifies a single column in the CSV file that contains name authority
# data.  (That is, citation information for each taxon name, such as "Linnaeus 1758".)
# The citation data will be applied to the lowest-level taxon that is present in each
# CSV file row (usually species or subspecies).

#
# citation_Rankname = CSV_column_name

[rank_mappings]
# The definitions in the rank_mappings section indicate which columns from the input
# CSV file contain taxonomy information and how they map to the rank names used in
# the database.  The format is:
#
# CSV_column_name: database_rank_name
#
# For example, to indicate that the column "ScientificName" in the source CSV file
# contains the species name, the following definition would be used:
#
# ScientificName: Species
#
# If a column name in the CSV file matches the rank name in the database, then the
# definition would be written like this:
#
# Family: Family
#
# "_ParseGenus" is a special pseudo-column name that indicates the genus name for each
# taxon is not provided as a column in the CSV file and should instead be parsed from
# the species name string.  It is used like this:
#
# _ParseGenus: Genus
#
# Similarly, "_ParseSubspecies" is a special pseudo-column name that indicates that
# subspecies names are not provided in a separate column and should instead be parsed
# from the species name string.  It is used like this:
#
# _ParseSubspecies: Subspecies
#
Subspecies: Subspecies
Species: Species
_ParseGenus: Genus
#FAMILY: Family
#ORDER1: Order
